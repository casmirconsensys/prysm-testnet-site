    <a href="https://launchpad.ethereum.org/" target="_blank">Ethereum 2.0</a> is a public blockchain which implements the Ethereum 2.0 Phase 0 [specification](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs) for a proof-of-stake network,
    enabling anyone holding ETH to join and participate. You can join by directly participating in the official Ethereum 2.0 <a href="https://launchpad.ethereum.org/">launchpad</a>. Our team, Prysmatic Labs, created a client implementation for Ethereum 2.0 written in Go, called <a href="https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm" target="_blank">Prysm</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The <b>only</b> and <b>official</b> Validator Deposit Contract is <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000219ab540356cbb839cbe05303d7705fa">0x00000000219ab540356cbb839cbe05303d7705fa</a>. Do not send funds to any other contract, and <b>do not send ETH directly to the contract</b>. If you want to participate in eth2, use the eth2 launchpad <a href="https://launchpad.ethereum.org">launchpad.ethereum.org</a>. Prysmatic Labs endorses this address as the recommended way to become an eth2 validator.

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <h3>What is Prysm?</h3>
    <p>
    Built in Go and fully-open source, the network runs on an eth2 node implementation called <a href="https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm" target="_blank">Prysm</a>. To participate in the network, anyone can send {{DEPOSIT_AMOUNT}} ETH from ETH1.0 into
      the official Validator Deposit Contract <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000219ab540356cbb839cbe05303d7705fa">0x00000000219ab540356cbb839cbe05303d7705fa</a>, which will queue in the user as a <b>validator</b> in the system. Validators participate in proposing and voting on blocks in the protocol, and the network applies rewards/penalties based on their behavior.

    <h3>Why should I care?</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs" target="_blank">Ethereum 2.0</a> is a massive, multi-year effort to create a true world computer. In other words, its goal is to create a truly decentralized, permissionless platform for programmable money through smart contracts. Phase 0, which Prysm 
      implements, is a great step forward in making the years of research behind the future of Ethereum a tangible reality.

    <h3>Can I donate to Prysmatic? ðŸ’°</h3>
    <p>
      We'd be extremely honored if you do! We are building a public good and every donation we receive, no matter how small, goes a long way towards building eth2.
      We're extremely motivated to work on this project every day and provide as much value as possible towards the future of Ethereum. The best way to donate
      would be to send ETH to our multisig contract, <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/prysmatic.eth" target="_blank">prysmatic.eth</a>.
